Hello! This is my README, and ill explain what this is about. (Its abt minecraft btw)
This is my texturepack for my server VoidTheGamer's Minigames and im just using GitHub because minecraft needs the texturepack uploaded. 
I will update the pack from tiem to time, tho when all the blocks i need are changed i dont think ill make any updates. I dont think anybody is gonna read this either. Well, fell free to download the modpack for your own world. 
Its designed for 1.21.3 but it says it wont work because its an older version. It works well, but ill fix that. Welllllllll... Bye!
